## Processe Swift UVOT data of Borisov & asteroids


This respository keeps files of a project named as the title, which is a part of a larger project led by Dr. A. H..
This is an ongoing project.
For asteroids, we expect to extract spectra from grism data 
and also do some temporal analyses; For the new observations of Borisov, we expect to sum all images to see what interesting results can be obtained.

This work is mainly being done by Z. X. from HKU, when she is visiting Auburn U from Oct, and she is guided by Dr. D. B., who is really a nice mentor and deserves great great thanks.
